  <p>Hello, thank you for clicking! <br> I'm Claudia, a full-stack student at Code Insitute. This is my first JavaScript project. <br> If you like it, I'd really appreciate your support. But instead of the usual "buy me a coffee", I'd prefer if you could support my loved ones in Ukraine. <br>They need our help, here's the official link.<br>
    <a href="https://supportukrainenow.org/" target="_blank">Support Ukraine now</a> <br> You will find many ways to support, just chose the ones that best fit your capabilities. Developers are needed too.
